# Code Search

Search for real, working code examples using Exa API.

Uses the @exa-code-context skill to find relevant code snippets, API usage patterns, and implementation examples.

## Usage

Provide your search query as an argument:
- `/code-search React hooks state management`
- `/code-search FastAPI async endpoints`
- `/code-search pandas dataframe filtering`

The skill will search billions of GitHub repos and return token-efficient, real-world examples.
