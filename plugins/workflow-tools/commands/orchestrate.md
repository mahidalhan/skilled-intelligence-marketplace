# Orchestrate

Plan complex multi-step tasks with optimal execution order.

Uses the @task-orchestrator skill to analyze dependencies, identify parallelism opportunities, and create a sorted task plan.

## Output

- Task batches with dependency analysis
- Parallel tasks grouped together
- Sequential tasks in separate batches
- Execution only after explicit approval

## Usage

Describe the complex task to plan:
- `/orchestrate refactor the auth module`
- `/orchestrate set up CI/CD pipeline`
- `/orchestrate migrate database schema`
