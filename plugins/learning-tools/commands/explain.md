# Explain

Learn code concepts with interactive, layer-by-layer explanations.

Uses the @explainer skill to build understanding from absolute basics, verifying comprehension before advancing.

## Approach

- Foundation first - starts from the most basic concepts
- Layer-by-layer progression with explicit levels
- Comprehension questions between layers
- Recursive term handling - every technical term gets explained

## Usage

Provide what you want to understand:
- `/explain how React hooks work`
- `/explain database indexing`
- `/explain async/await`
