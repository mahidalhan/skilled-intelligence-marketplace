# Threaded Explainer

Learn concepts with resumable chunks and lineage tracking.

Uses the @threaded-explainer skill for chunked, interruptible explanations. Ask follow-up questions mid-explanation without losing context.

## Features

- Chunked output (one concept per chunk)
- Interrupt handling - ask questions mid-explanation
- Lineage tracking - thread context is preserved
- Comprehension gates - checks understanding before advancing

## Usage

Provide what you want to learn:
- `/threaded-explainer how OAuth2 works`
- `/threaded-explainer microservices patterns`
- `/threaded-explainer database transactions`

Interrupt anytime with questions - context is preserved.
